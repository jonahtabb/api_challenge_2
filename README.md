## WEATHER WATCH
### An Api implementation project

---

This is my second project completed for Eleven Fifty Academy Coding Bootcamp. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with implementing api fetches using Javascript.  

### Tools Used
- Vanilla Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Bootstrap v5.0
- Figma
- Coolers (color pallet designer)

### APIs Used<br>
- IQ Air API (https://www.iqair.com/us/air-pollution-data-api)<br>
  Used to fetch data from US weather stations and populate the weather widget.
- Google Cloud Platform, Places API<br>
  Used To fetch photographs from US Cities.

### Project Overview
This project uses data and images from 2 APIs to dynamically generate cards with information on pollution and weather data from U.S. cities. I designed the layout and color scheme in Figma. Bootstrap enabled me efficiently implement a responsive layout, while using a custom CSS Style to implement my original design from Figma.  

### Takaways
- Bootstrap is effective at quickly creating a responsive framework, however when used for dynamic dom element creation in JS, the Bootstrap classes can make the dom element creation hard to parse for the human eye.
- Sometimes the 'small adjustments' at the end take longer than expected.
